# Customer Segmentation Project
**Overview**
This repository features a customer segmentation project that utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize mall customers based on their transaction behaviors. The project leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to extract insightful features for effective segmentation.

**Key Features**
***Dataset***:
Utilized a mall customer dataset containing information such as 'CustomerID,' 'TransactionDate,' 'Amount,' and additional relevant features.

***RFM Analysis***:
Conducted RFM analysis to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, capturing unique patterns in customer spending habits.

***K-Means Clustering***:
Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their RFM features.

***Optimal Cluster Count***:
Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method for enhanced segmentation precision.

***Visualization***:
Visualized the segmentation results through intuitive bar charts, illustrating the distribution of customers across different clusters.
